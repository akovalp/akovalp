Hi there! I'm Alp Akova, a PhD Candidate in Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Trento, Italy. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

My passion lies at the intersection of **cognitive aging**, **EEG analysis**, and **machine learning**. I leverage computational tools to understand brain health, particularly focusing on how physical activity impacts brain connectivity and aging trajectories.

---

### ðŸ”­ What I'm Currently Focused On:

*   Investigating the link between physical activity and brain aging using **EEG-based brain age prediction (Brain-PAD)** models.
*   Developing machine learning frameworks (primarily with **PyTorch**) to analyze EEG biomarkers for cognitive health assessment.
*   Exploring frequency-specific neural oscillations and cross-frequency coupling as indicators of cognitive aging, using large-scale datasets (LEMON, ADNI, PhysioNet) and primary data collection.

---

### ðŸ§  Key Areas & Skills:

*   **Computational Neuroscience:** EEG Analysis (EEGLAB, MNE, FieldTrip), Brain Age Prediction (Brain-PAD), Signal Processing (ICA), Neural Synchronization, Brain Networks.
*   **Machine Learning & Data Science:** Python (PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy), Deep Learning (CNNs, LSTMs), Ensemble Methods, SQL, Vector Databases (Pinecone).
*   **Computational Linguistics & NLP:** Large Language Models (LLMs - OpenAI, Ollama), Natural Language Processing (spaCy, NLTK), Prompt Engineering, API Integration (FastAPI, Langchain).
*   **Tools & Technologies:** MATLAB, R (Shiny), Docker, Git/GitHub, Weights & Biases.

---

### âœ¨ Experience Highlights:

*   **Engineering Researcher @ Subconscious AI:** Engineered LLM-powered decision systems, developed interactive experiment dashboards (R Shiny, W&B), and improved model alignment using robust evaluation frameworks (achieving a 25% improvement in Spearman R correlation).
*   **Research Intern @ University of Padova (Baby Lab):** Conducted comparative LLM analysis (ChatGPT, Claude, LLaMA) and built an end-to-end LLM agent for personalized language learning materials.

---

### ðŸŒ± Always Learning:

I'm continuously exploring advanced deep learning architectures, multimodal data integration techniques, and novel approaches for interpretable AI in neuroscience.
